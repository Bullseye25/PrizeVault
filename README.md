## 🌟 The Vision
PrizeVault is built to solve a critical problem in DeFi: **User Retention**. 
While trading is risky, **saving** should be fun. 

We are building the first **"No-Loss" Prize Savings Protocol** native to the [Base](https://base.org) ecosystem. By combining the safety of a savings account with the adrenaline of a lottery, we aim to onboard the next **10,000 users** to Base, driving significant TVL (Total Value Locked) and daily engagement.

## 💡 The Problem vs. Solution

| The Old Way (Lottery) ❌ | The PrizeVault Way ✅ |
| :--- | :--- |
| You pay for a ticket ($5) | You deposit USDC (Free) |
| If you lose, your money is **GONE** | If you don't win, you **KEEP** your money |
| High Risk, Negative Sum Game | **No Loss**, Positive Sum Game |

**How do we do it?** 
The prize comes from the **yield** generated by the collective deposits (or protocol fees), ensuring users never touch their principal.

## 🔄 User Flow (Simple & Transparent)

1.  **💰 Deposit**: Connect your wallet and store USDC in the `PrizeVault` Smart Contract. 
    *   *1 USDC = 1 Ticket.*
2.  **⏳ Wait**: Every 24 hours, our contract executes a verifiable draw.
3.  **🎉 Win**:
    *   **Winner**: Takes the entire Prize Pool.
    *   **Everyone Else**: Keeps their deposit and automatically plays again tomorrow.
4.  **🔓 Withdraw**: Need your money? Withdraw your full principal instantly. No lockups.

## 🛠 Technology Stack (On-Chain Backend)
Our "Backend" is fully decentralized, running on the **Base Blockchain**.

*   **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (Logic, State, Deposits).
*   **Randomness**: Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) for tamper-proof draws.
*   **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + Tailwind CSS (Glassmorphism UI).
*   **Wallet**: RainbowKit + Wagmi.

### Smart Contract Logic (`/contracts/PrizeVault.sol`)
*   **`deposit(amount)`**: Securely locks user funds and issues 'tickets'.
*   **`drawWinner()`**: Calculates the prize (Yield) and pseudo-randomly selects a winner.
*   **`withdraw()`**: allowing users to reclaim their principal 1:1.

## 🎯 Why This Grant Matters
We have a working MVP (Testnet). This grant will empower us to:
1.  **Security Audit**: Ensure user funds are 100% safe before Mainnet.
2.  **Yield Integration**: Connect with Aave/Compound on Base to generate *real* yield prizes.
3.  **Mainnet Launch**: Deploy to Base Mainnet and kickstart the initial prize pool.
